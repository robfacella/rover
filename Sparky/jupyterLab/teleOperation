Default steering is Katamari Style, 
	twin stick up for foward
	twin stick down for back
	1-Up 1-Down to Spin/turn
ie. each stick controls it's respective wheel

Default Throttle appears to be 0 to 100

jpeg module an empty file
init camera and link to file
jpeg module becomes a video feed

Continuing through teleoperation module and 
trying to test piloting from perspective of camera and 
upon making a turn Sparky shutdown

Reloading took a few moments, as expected but

errors upon initial motor testing
eventually connected.
Got camera feed going again,
Start to Steer to turn same corner
Dies again.

Attempting to charge battery but it was ~50%,
