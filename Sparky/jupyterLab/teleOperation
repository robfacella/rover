Default steering is Katamari Style, 
	twin stick up for foward
	twin stick down for back
	1-Up 1-Down to Spin/turn

jpeg module an empty file
init camera and link to file
jpeg module becomes a video feed

Continuing through teleoperation module and 
trying to test piloting from perspective of camera and

errors upon initial motor testing
eventually connected.
Got camera feed going again,
Start to Steer to turn same corner
Dies again.

Attempting to charge battery but it was ~50%,
